## What was my motivation?
To use all my knowledge from the previous weeks in Coding Bootcamp to build an app from scratch that allows a non-devloper business owner to easily view and interact with their employee information stored on a database.

## What did I do?
Build a content management systems (CMS) app to manage a company's employee database using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL.

## What did I learn?
- How to implement asynchronous queries in MySQL.
- A range of MySQL queries needed to retrieve the information needed.
- How best to import and export functions across various files.

## Usage
1) Start the app using:

```bash
node index
```

2) Follow the user prompts to view, update or delete entries from the database.
